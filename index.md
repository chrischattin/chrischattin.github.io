Good Day!

I am a part time Ruby on Rails consultant. I work on my own projects and with very early startups to build MVP's and find product market fit.

I also fly the Pilatus PC-12 as a contract commercial pilot.

Feel free to contact me at chrischattin (at) gmail (dot) com, or @chrischattin on Twitter.
